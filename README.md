**File: Weighing Basics**

Learning objectives

● Understand the role of weighing and integrate it into your
speeches

● Distinguish between principled (categorical) vs pragmatic
(consequentialist) weighing

● Analyse and apply different weighing metrics
Try a popular clash: Would you kill one person to save five?

Pragmatics vs Principles

Pragmatics: focus on utility, that is, something is good because it leads to the best
outcomes. -> Max happiness for max people

● But what are the best outcomes? Most preferences fulfilled? Most urgent
preferences fulfilled? Where is the maximum happiness?

● Trolley problem: killing 1 person is the ethical choice because it leads to the best
possible outcome in this scenario -> saving 5 lives

Principles: focus on the moral value of an argument, based on rights, duties and moral
obligations.

● Individuals are an end in and of themselves, never means to an end

● Some things are worth defending regardless of the consequences

● Trolley: problem killing 1 man, even if to save 5, still is killing 1 man at the end of
the day. Blood is on ur hands regardless

In debating-land, where we all live

● Utility almost always wins. Most debates occur within a solely utilitarian paradigm,
where consequence is the only metric of value.

● That doesn’t mean principled pushes should be thrown out of the window, but that
they are inherently tied to how they help the stakeholders you choose to base your
case around.

● Even if you are running principled arguments, you need to prove how the outcome
of upholding your value ultimately accrues better impacts.

TH, as the US, should increase humanitarian aid to the
countries undergoing crises.

Principled argument:

● USA is a wealthy country, which
has more than it needs.

● People in countries undergoing
crises are suffering from war,
economic disruption, poverty and
famine.

● To allow people to die
unnecessarily while we can afford
to give them what we need is
simply immoral.

Pragmatic argument:

● Without aid, countries slide into
chaos.

● Chaos leaves them liable to
takeover by dictators and
extremists which may be hostile to
the West.

● With aid, they can be encouraged
to be stable liberal democracies
which will not threaten the US, and
with which we can trade.

What is weighing?

● Process of comparing the relative importance of arguments

● It determines what should influence the judge more

How do you weigh?

● By establishing certain metrics- yardstick- to quantify the impact of your arguments

● Simply put, you measure which side’s impacts are bigger, faster or more probable.

Core weighing metrics : TIMEFRAME

Long term impacts:

● Case looks more farsighted,

● Shows the effects on society in the
long run and for perhaps several
generations,

● Shows the effect and implications on
the working of other institutions and
social structures (govt, education,
cultural dynamics)

Short term impacts:

● Establishes urgency,

● More relevant in showcasing matters
of life and death,

● In cases of war, disease, poverty and
marginalisation of groups, short term
impacts become especially important.

Core weighing metrics : SCOPE & SCALE

Scale: how much

● The strength of an impact (be it
negative/positive)

● Rate these from 0 to 10

○ You stub your toe in a corner

○ Nuclear war happens

○ A cure for cancer is found

○ The power supply of a country is
shut down for 6 hours

The more serious it is, the more important
it is to solve.

Scope: how many

● The quantity of people affected

● Your case could have strong impacts,
but if it only helps 10 people, it really
isn’t helping anyone at all.

Core weighing metrics: LIKELIHOOD

● Which side’s impacts are likelier or more probable?

● Remember, AP arguments run on assumptions.

● So, what is likelier to happen will inherently be more convincing. And more
important to work towards.

● Rate these from 0 to 10:

○ Someone somewhere wakes up with a headache.

○ The sun explodes.

○ The gov passes a law giving everyone 5000 inr.


THBT developing countries should prioritise economic
growth over climate protection. GOV

Framing: poverty is a present, deadly crisis. Economic growth is the path to education,
health, equity and innovation.

● Growth enables human development. It reduces infant mortality, increases life
expectancy and improves literacy. Clean energy and sustainability are only
possible after hitting developmental benchmarks.

● Green standards are colonial and hypocritical. The Global North pollutes for
200 years and now punishes developing countries by creating unjust barriers for
industrialisation.

● Energy needs are immediate. Millions lack electricity and cooking fuel. Fossil
fuels remain the cheapest option for energy access in the short term.

THBT developing countries should prioritise economic
growth over climate protection. OPP

Framing: environmental destruction creates poverty and suffering. It disproportionately
affects the global south. Sustainability is not a luxury- it is a necessity for survival.

● Climate change is a poverty multiplier. Developing countries face the most
severe consequences (floods, crop failure, disease).

● Intergenerational responsibility. It’s unjust to destroy the planet, knowing future
generations will suffer.

● Global responsibility. The planet is shared. Everyone, including developing
nations, has an ethical stake in its preservation.

Weighing Breakdown: Analyse the impacts and weigh
what is applicable, and more relevant.

Weighing Questions

● Should the rights of future people outweigh the needs of the living poor?

● Is agency and right to self-development more important than external
responsibility?

● Can developing countries morally justify pollution if it ensures survival?

● If both paths involve harms, which harm is more justifiable? What trade off are you
willing to make?

● Does a nation’s historical trajectory (colonisation) affect how we weigh its
contemporary actions?

**File: Characterisations & Framing**
Structure (Index):
- what are characterisations and framing
- why should you do those things (well)
- principles of characterisation
- practical concerns

- what to characterise
- structuring characterisations
- employing characterisations
- rebutting characterisations

- how to use characterisations as your winning
strategy

what are characterisations and framing
--- characterisations
- parts of your speech where you are describing
different actors or different contexts in order to make
your arguments more plausible or more relevant
--- framing
- a very confusing term which people use for a variety of
different things
- can be thought of as the aggregate of all the pieces of
characterisation you deployed throughout your case,
ultimately painting a picture of the world that helps your
case

why you should do them (well)
- many, if not most, higher level rooms
are won and lost on characterisations;
they're often much more powerful
than we realise (or the judges realise!)

- many currently popular motions are
extremely characterisation-heavy (e.g.
all narrative, norms, glorification
motions)

- it makes a massive difference for
your speech - often allows you to get
many extra speaks

- something you can improve on in a
relatively short period of time

principles of characterisation

- there is no completely fixed context within which debates take place,
there is a spectrum of subjectivity
- this gives you the opportunity to describe the reality in a way that
suits your case
- but there are things outside of that spectrum - you cannot go
completely silly
e.g. Russia
- can describe Putin's regime as very stable (e.g. nationalism,
recent succesful power projections)
- can describe Putin's regime as potentially vulnerable (e.g.
recent protests, issues with rigged referendums, scandals with
opposition)
- BUT cannot go wild and claim Russia is a North Korea-like
dictatorship or on the brink of a revolution

- characterisations are powerful because they sound objective -
confidence when delivering is key

principles of characterisation ii

- your characterisations will be more plausible the more
nuanced you are - how to achieve this?
- stop thinking of actors as monoliths (e.g. countries, social
movements, companies)
- decisions are being made by groups and individuals
within these, with varying levels of influence
- e.g. political parties, religious organisations, army /
allies, leaders, donors / stakeholders, workers, board
of directors)
- stop thinking of all actors as inherently rational
- not everyone always weighs up their interests and
then makes a decision - people act on anger,
confusion, grief - think of different psychological
processes
- consider long term trajectories and trends
- often people characterise through examples - it is
better to research structural reasons as to why an
actor is likely to act certain way across time and space
(e.g. the U.S and bad interventions)

practical concerns

- what to characterise
- in many cases, very obvious from the motion
- if you are giving an actor extra power (e.g. the IMF, teachers
vs. parents motions) you want to characterise them as good
- if you are banning something, you want to portray how
incredibly harmful this is
→ work on your intuition - the more you debate/prep motions,
the clearer this will be!
- what if it is not?
- you can always work backwards
- work out the main points you are going to be arguing and see
what might need characterising
- ask yourself
- is the other side likely to contest this? → high priority
- are the impacts of my argument dependent on this
characterisation?

practical concerns ii

- structuring characterisations
- basic structure
- descriptive claim
- justification
- implication
- descriptive claim
- the assertive part of your characterisation - describe
the actor/the context/the norm
- think of your language - use the appropriate words to
forward the correct emotion to the judge (e.g. are you
coercing or encouraging?)
- justification
- provide reasons as to why what you are claiming is
true
- implication
- tell the judge extremely clearly how your
characterisation impacted the debate - did it take any
arguments down? Strengthened others? Shifted
burdens?

THBT it is in the interest of the ruling party of Kazakhstan to hold free and fair local elections of local officials

- characterisation I: people are still likely to vote for party-sympathetic candidates in these elections
- opposition in Kazakhstan has been stifled for many years → no opposition candidates to actually
run
- the ruling party is not massively resented yet - providing decent economic development etc.  <--------- outframing opp
→ the implication of this is that this is unlikely to weaken the power of the ruling party     <--------- outframing opp

- characterisation II: the current trend is going in such direction that it is likely that without any change
at all, people will eventually (and likely soon) become resentful of the government, which can lead to
much more threatening protests and riots
- new president without personality cult
- recent scandals regarding freedom of press
- protests in nearby countries e.g. Belarus could inspire

→ all of this means that the context the ruling party of Kazakhstan finds itself in is very delicate - it has
enough support at this very moment so that this move would not threaten its power, but there are
reasons to believe that if nothing is done, there might be a very significant risk of them losing power in  <--------- making our arguement relevent & clarifying why it's not contradictory
the near future. This all means that the argument about appeasing the population is extremely relevant
in the current context.

argument:
this will appease the population, by giving them a democratic right they
care about, which will disincentivise them from protesting

practical concerns iii

- employing characterisations
- where to place characterisations in your speech?
- distinction between arguments and characterisations is often
blurry - characterisations can be throughout speech
- start of the speech - introduction (opportunity for a nice
rhetorical intro to describe the overall context)
- THS the shaming of individuals as a tactic for social
movements to catalyse change (e.g. shaming individuals
for not taking environmentally sustainable actions)
- start of each argument ('the context in which you should
consider this argument')
- often the very first argument (e.g. how will this look like)
- THBT sex education classes in schools should teach
techniques for sexual gratification

- recommend NOT to do it with impacts - judge might have already
zoned out during your argument because did not see the relevance

THBT sex education classes in schools should teach techniques for sexual gratification
(including, but not limited to, anal sex, oral sex, mutual gratification and masturbation)

OPP

this is going to be empowering and
will provide information that is
otherwise unavailable/misleading in
a safe manner and safe space

- this will be uncomfortable and
humiliating which means it will
actually create unhealthy attitudes
among kids towards sex because
the association with shame and will
prevent us from teaching useful
things such as consent, safety etc.

characterisation that proves one or the other: what will this education look like?

practical concerns iv

- rebutting characterisations
- make sure you pay attention to other teams
characterisations - do not just concede things because

they sound intuitive (but if you are going to counter-
characterise something non-intuitive, be real about it)

- structuring rebuttal
- expose their characterisation - the power of it lays in
the idea of objectivity
- question it in the same way as you would question
mechanisms
- is this logical?
- would this apply to all cases or to only a limited
number?
- provide your counter-characterisation and weigh-up
- engage with their 'best case' anyway (but make it
clear to the judges that you are doing that)

characterisations as a winning strategy

- helps with weigh-ups in general - allow you to make your arguments
more relevant and the other side's arguments less plausible
- great way to win from closing
- 'OO posited actor X could act in Y way, which would be bad - we
characterised why they are likely to act like that in the majority of
cases'
- 'OG explained why this would create more voter engagement, we
will explain why this is so crucial to happen right now in the
context of country X'
→ this makes your opening's mechanims dependent on you
- overcredit the opposite bench to pretend your characterisation is
THE most important point - 'our opening said X, that is plausible,
but OG responded with Y, which sounds equally plausible, so you
really need our characterisation to adjudicate this'
- 'outframe' the entire top half/debate
- e.g. Zagreb EUDC 2014 final
- THW incentivise people to work from home

**End of File: Chararacterisations & Framing**

**File: Linear Flow**

what's wrong with most matter speeches
- reasons why people suck at making arguments
- significant portions are missing (e.g. impacts, framing, logical links)
- it's unclear where a point is going
time is wasted talking about meaningless details
the argument is hard to follow and thus credit
all of this can be avoided by becoming disciplined with how your argument is presented and internally structured
in other words, your speech should have a clear, clean linear flow

what is linear flow
- the linear flow of an argument is how you get from Point A (the beginning of an argument) to Point B (the end)
every step along the way is necessary, and no steps should be wasted on things that don't get you to Point B
the flow will look different for each debate and case, but it typically resembles this:
problem/framing → why the problem arises → analysis/mechanisms of change → impact → weighing

1) Problem/Framing
2) Why the problem arises 
3) Analysis/Mechanisms of change 
4) Impact 
5) Weighing
1) and 2) you cannot make an argument unless the judge understands WHY you're making it - is there a problem to fix in the first place?
analysing why the problem arises also helps to set up your mechanisms/analysis it makes it seem like you're targeting the ROOT of the problem
3) - this shows how the problem CHANGES to better or worse
4) and 5) - your argument means nothing if you don't tell me what those changes results in, and why that matters
e.g. THW institute 'sin taxes'

tiering your analysis: what is it, why do it?
tiering = giving multiple levels
why do it?
- much harder for an opponent to rebut EVERYTHING that you say
much more comprehensive cases that cover different dimensions of the problem
- problems (such as the underrepresentation of minorities in certain industries, or economic inequality, or the rise of dangerous populism) arise because of a multitude of reasons
- the actors involved also respond in a multitude of ways to the motion - it's important to cover as much as possible to be persuasive*
*this does not mean you should bite off more than you can chew!

       -> ROOT 1 -> Mechanism 1
problem -> ROOT 2 -> Mechanism 2
       -> ROOT 3 -> Mechanism 3

                -> Mechanism 1
problem -> ROOT -> Mechanism 2
                -> Mechanism 3

multiple roots to a problem
Motion: THW legalise all drugs
Problem: drug cartels are a really big problem in Mexico (murder, funnel their drug profits into e.g. trafficking, rig elections)
Root 1 - recruitment
Root 2 - necessity of violence
Root 3 - money from drugs
Mechanism 1 - no more recruiting from prisons
Mechanism 2 - no more face-offs against police, intimidating local people, or hiring security to smuggle drugs
Mechanism 3 - people now buy drugs from non-cartel sources

different incentives

Motion - THW adopt gender quota policies in corporate senior management
Problem: too few women are represented in the upper echelons of business
Root - women are discriminated against in hiring policies, and often face hostile working environments from the ground-up (sexist cultures)
Mechanism 1 - POLICY: women in senior positions are likely to pass policies that make workplaces less hostile (e.g. maternity leave)
Mechanism 2 - NORMS: people become normalised to working with and under women in senior positions
Mechanism 3 - OPTICS: more women strive for upper positions when they have role models and know that a place is allotted to them


different actors

Motion: THW restrict EU development aid to member states with anti-democratic practices 
Problem: member states in the EU (e.g. Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania) are violating EU principles of political rights 
ROOT:  rise of populist strongmen who restrict political freedoms, stack the judiciary, arrest journalists etc.
Mech 1 PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES: more resentment towards strongmen for taking away their material wealth
Mech 2 STRONGMEN: deterred from being anti-democratic if they now face consequences
Mech 3 BORDERLINE COUNTRIES (e.g. Greece): observe Poland/Bulgaria being punished, and so local people are swayed away from populism

different contexts

Motion: THBT it is in the interest of dominant organised religions for their leaders to declare more progressive interpretations of traditional dogma (e.g. on dietary and pilgrimage requirements, the acceptability of contraception, same-sex relationships)
Problem: too many people are leaving organised, religion
Root: this is because dominant organised religions are overly strict dogma that drives moderates away
Mech 1 - DEVELOPED WORLD: now you're just going to drive the most devoted away. Progressive religious beliefs are too similar to secular beliefs, and hence provide no comparative value.
Mech 2 - DEVELOPING WORLD: the people who pass as 'radicals' in the developed world are just moderates in the developing world. It is likely you evolve to be too progressive for mainstream society to accept.

other ways you can tier your analysis
-
- second-order impacts
lots of impacts have secondary impacts
for example, increasing the inclusion of minorities in higher education through affirmative action is good not only for those minorities (i.e. for their employment, education etc.), but has second-order impacts: children of parents who go to uni are more likely to go as well because they see it as a safer option
- you can tier your analysis such that giving one easily provable impact that allows you branch off into many secondary impacts
- short term and long term
similarly, look at how a motion operates over different timescales
e.g. compelling media companies to have more minority representation
- many times it results in short-term immediate representation but long-term normalisation of seeing minorities in a diverse set of roles in all of society

**File: Dissecting the Prime Minister Speech**

Dissecting First Speeches (PM and LO)
Why Focus on PM Speeches?

Sets the entire case direction and framing.
Defines the interpretation of the motion.
Introduces core burdens and policy/stance.
Offers opportunity for early clash or mitigation.

Structure of PM Speech

1. Context and Framing
2. Definition (if needed)
3. Model (for policy motions)
4. Burden of Proof
5. Team Line and Roles
6. Arguments (1–2 max, in-depth)

Structure of LO Speech
1. Direct Rebuttal to PM
2. Counter-Framing or Counter-Model (if needed)
3. Opposition Stance
4. Team Line and Role Split
5. Opposition Arguments (1–2 max)

Let’s dissect all parts of the PM/ LO speech in detail
1. Context and Framing
● Give background or urgency of the topic.
● Highlight why this debate matters now.
Set a tone or lens to view the issue through (e.g., global south lens, feminist lens)
●
Example:
Motion: This House Would ban animal testing
Framing: “Today we look at a world where animals are routinely harmed in labs
despite better alternatives.”

2. Clarify the motion
● Explain what key terms mean.
● Clarify what the debate includes or excludes.
● Avoid unfair definitions (i.e., “squirreling”).
Example:
Motion: This House Believes that social media does more harm than good.
Define: “Social media” refers to platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook used
for communication, entertainment, and news.

3. The model (if it’s a wills/would motion)

● What is being proposed?
● Who will do it?
● How will it be done?

4. Burden of Proof

● What does your side need to show to win?
● What does the other side need to prove?
● Are you proposing a change? Justify why change is better than status
quo.
Example:
“We need to prove that the change will result in more benefit than
harm.”

5. Arguments

As a PM/LO - introduce 2- 3 arguments in your speech. Make sure each argument
has a clear claim and follows the TMIE structure.
Title
Mechanism (how it works)
Impact (why it matters)
Examples or evidence

Common Mistakes to Avoid

● Rushing into arguments without setup
(Spend 3-4 Minutes on framing and characterization)

● Overloading with 3–4 weak arguments
(Run 2 complete arguments)
● Forgetting to explain why the motion matters
● Using personal opinions without logic

Tip: Clarity and structure > speed or style
